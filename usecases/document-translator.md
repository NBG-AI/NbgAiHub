ai_summary: A complaint arrives in Greek and the case needs to escalate to a non-Greek-speaking senior in Frankfurt. Or the reverse — a London supplier sends an English contract that needs to land in front of Athens legal. Claude translates both ways and flags the phrases that don't carry across.
business_unit: operations
time_estimate: "~15 min"
difficulty: beginner
order: 11
outcome: A markdown file with the original on the left and the translation on the right, plus a "notes" section flagging phrases where Claude is uncertain or where literal translation would mislead.
inputs:
  - Nothing — Claude will invent a realistic Greek customer complaint email to practise on. (Once you trust the loop, swap in real anonymised correspondence — names, IBANs, account numbers stripped first.)
  - Claude Code installed and a terminal open (see Day 1)

NBG isn't a wildly cross-border bank, but the occasional Athens-Frankfurt case or London supplier email still lands on someone's desk. When it does, the translation isn't a hard linguistic problem — it's a context problem. Google Translate gives you a word-for-word version that's grammatically fine and tonally wrong. The case escalation reads as flat or rude in the target language; the supplier's "by EOB Friday" lands in Greek inboxes as ambiguous.

This use case treats translation as a structured task: original on the left, target on the right, *notes on what didn't carry across* on the bottom. The notes are where the value lives.

> **Compliance check before you start.** Customer correspondence is internal-confidential. If you're translating a complaint, strip the customer's name, IBAN, and any account numbers before pasting into Claude — same posture as the "empathic reply" use case. Translating a *contract* is different: confirm with your line manager whether the document classification permits AI-assisted handling. When in doubt, ask before you paste.

## Step 1 — Build the workspace

**Open the Terminal app.**

<div data-os="mac">

Press ⌘+Space, type "Terminal", and press Enter.

</div>

<div data-os="windows">

Open the Start menu (press the Windows key), type "Ubuntu", and press Enter. If you don't see Ubuntu listed, [install WSL first](/start-here/day-1/#d1).

In Ubuntu, `~/Desktop` is a folder inside WSL's Linux home (`/home/<your-Linux-username>/Desktop`) — **not** the Windows desktop you see in File Explorer at `C:\Users\...\Desktop`. That's fine: the files are real and Claude can read and write them. Anywhere this use case says "open in Finder / File Explorer", run `explorer.exe .` from your Ubuntu terminal — Windows opens that exact WSL folder in Explorer.


</div>

Type each line:

```
mkdir ~/Desktop/translate-complaint
cd ~/Desktop/translate-complaint
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

- `mkdir ~/Desktop/translate-complaint` — make a folder on your Desktop.
- `cd ~/Desktop/translate-complaint` — move into it.
- `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` — start Claude Code here. The flag stops Claude prompting you for permission on every file write — safe in a fresh, dedicated folder like this one. (If you'd rather see every prompt for your first run, just type `claude` — same thing, more interruptions.)

The cursor is now Claude's.

## Step 2 — Ask Claude to invent a realistic Greek complaint

You don't have a real Greek email to hand and you don't need one. Tell Claude:

> Create a file called `source.md` in this folder. Write a realistic synthetic complaint email in Greek (~180 words) that a long-standing NBG retail customer might send. The complaint: their mortgage statement for May arrived showing a higher monthly payment than agreed, the contact-centre couldn't explain it on the phone, and they're now worried it's a covert rate change.
>
> Tone in Greek: formal-but-frustrated. Use phrases a real customer would use — including at least two formal Greek constructions that don't translate cleanly to English (the kind of thing where the literal translation loses tone). Use placeholders `[CUSTOMER NAME]` and `[ACCOUNT]` instead of inventing personal data.
>
> Sign off with the formal Greek closing convention (Με εκτίμηση,).
>
> No real names, no real IBANs.

Claude writes the file straight away. The Greek text now lives in `source.md`.

That's the small surprise: Claude can generate the *input* document, not just process it. When you do this on real customer correspondence, the only thing that changes is what's in `source.md`.

---

## Step 3 — Brief Claude with the *purpose* of the translation

A literal translation is rarely what you want. Tell Claude who reads this, why they're reading it, and what they need to do with it.

> Create a file called `context.md`. Put these 5 lines inside it:
>
> ```
> Source language: Greek
> Target language: English (UK)
> Reader: a non-Greek-speaking senior risk officer in Frankfurt
> Reader's purpose: decide whether to escalate this complaint to legal in the next 24 hours
> Tone needed: formal but warm — must convey the customer's emotional state accurately without sounding sensationalist
> ```

Claude writes the file straight away.

The "tone needed" line is the one that separates good translation from mechanical translation. Spend a minute on it.

---

## Step 4 — Ask for the structured translation

Send this to Claude:

> Read `source.md` and `context.md`.
>
> Produce `translation.md` with three sections, exactly in this order:
>
> **Section 1 — Side by side.** A two-column markdown table. Left column: the original Greek paragraph. Right column: the English translation. One row per paragraph in the original.
>
> **Section 2 — Translation notes.** Bullet list of phrases where any of the following applied:
>
> - The literal translation would mislead the reader about tone or intent
> - The Greek used an idiom or formal register that doesn't have a clean English equivalent
> - A word has two plausible English translations and you picked one — say which and why
> - The customer expressed something culturally specific (e.g. addressing the bank as `την Τράπεζα` — capitalised, almost personified — which loses force in English)
>
> Each note: the Greek phrase, the English you chose, one sentence on the trade-off.
>
> **Section 3 — One-line summary in the target language.** Three sentences in English summarising what the customer is unhappy about, what they want, and what the bank's stance currently is — designed to give the Frankfurt risk officer the picture in 30 seconds before they read the full translation.
>
> Do not soften emotional language. If the customer is angry, the translation should read as angry. The Frankfurt reader needs the real signal, not a polite version of it.

Press Enter. Translation + notes for a one-page email takes 30–60 seconds.

## Step 5 — Cross-check the notes, then send

Ask Claude to show you what it wrote:

> Show me `translation.md`.

Section 2 — the notes — is where the value is. Read it carefully. For each note:

- Does the trade-off Claude flagged actually match how the Greek read to you?
- Are there idioms or culturally specific phrases Claude *didn't* flag that you would have?

If you spot a missed nuance, tell Claude:

> The phrase "Δεν περιμένα κάτι τέτοιο από σας" — your literal translation "I didn't expect this from you" loses the implication that the customer's relationship with the bank is now damaged, not just disappointed. Flag this in the notes and adjust the English to "I didn't expect this kind of treatment from you" or similar.

Iterate until the notes feel honest.

*In a real cross-border thread you'd paste `translation.md` into Teams or Outlook for the Frankfurt senior, with the Section 3 summary as the first paragraph. We're pretending here — the file on your Desktop is the deliverable.*

The pattern works in either direction (English → Greek or Greek → English) and for any document type — contracts, internal memos, technical specifications. The structure (side-by-side, notes, one-line summary) stays. Only `context.md` changes.

Your reputation as the person who "handles the cross-border cases well" is built on getting the *notes* right — not on getting the translation perfect. Most colleagues won't notice a perfect translation; they'll notice when a nuance got flagged that they would otherwise have missed.

### Save your translation rules in `CLAUDE.md`

The three-section structure (side-by-side, translation notes, one-line summary) and your standards for what counts as a *worth-flagging* nuance don't change between documents. Save them as `CLAUDE.md`:

> Create a `CLAUDE.md` in this folder. Put in it my stable translation rules:
>
> - Output in three sections in this order: (1) two-column side-by-side table, one row per source paragraph; (2) translation notes — flag literal translations that would mislead, untranslatable idioms/register, words with two plausible English equivalents, and culturally specific phrases (e.g. Greek capitalised `την Τράπεζα` almost personifying the bank); (3) one-paragraph summary in the target language for the reader who reads first and skims the rest
> - Don't soften emotional language — if the source is angry, the translation reads angry
> - Notes are where the value is. A translation without flagged trade-offs is suspect

`CLAUDE.md` is the magic filename Claude Code reads automatically when you start `claude` in a folder containing it. Next document: copy this CLAUDE.md into a new folder, drop in the source, write a short per-document `context.md` (target language, reader, purpose, tone), run `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`. Your structure and standards are already loaded.
