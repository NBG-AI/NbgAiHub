A skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` (the instructions Claude follows) plus any supporting scripts, prompts, or assets. Drop it into `~/.claude/skills/` and Claude will pick it up. Skills are how you stop pasting the same 200-line prompt and instead say "use the X skill." They're the boring-but-good answer to "how do I scale this?"
