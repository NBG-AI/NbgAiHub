ai_summary: When you really do need to constrain Claude, pin the *requirements* (must run in under 200ms, must work offline, must not break the public API) — not the implementation choices Claude can pick freely.

Constraints are things that *must* be true about the result. They're not the same as implementation choices.

Bad constraint: "Use a `for` loop with an index counter."

Good constraint: "Must run in under 200ms on a 10,000-row input."

Good constraint: "Must not break the existing `User` Postgres schema — additive columns only."

Good constraint: "Output must be valid JSON that parses with the existing `validateUser()` schema."

Good constraint: "No new runtime dependencies — must work with what's already in `package.json`."

The difference: a *requirement* survives a refactor. An *implementation choice* doesn't. Pin the ones that survive.
