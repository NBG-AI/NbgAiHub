A Pull Request (PR) is how proposed changes enter the team's main code line. You push your branch, open a PR, and the rest of the team can read the diff, comment on lines, request changes, approve, and merge.

What a PR carries:

- The diff (what changed)
- A summary (the "why")
- Comments and review threads
- CI checks (tests, linters, validators that run automatically)
- Approval(s) and merge state

Claude Code opens PRs for you when you ask ("open a PR for these changes"). The body it drafts follows a standard template — summary + test plan. Tweak it before merging if you want.
