ai_summary: Two ways to use an LLM — at build time (Claude helps you create a tool once, then the tool runs without an LLM) versus runtime (the tool calls an LLM on every execution). Picking the right one matters for cost and data residency.

**Build time** — Claude Code helps you write a script, define a workflow, or scaffold a project. Once it's built, it runs on its own. No LLM in the loop at runtime. Predictable cost. Deterministic behaviour.

**Runtime** — The tool you built calls an LLM (Anthropic API, Azure OpenAI, Gemini) every time it runs. Used when the task requires *judgment* — classifying free text, summarising documents, extracting from messy input.

Why this distinction matters at the bank:

- Use deterministic code when you can — it's cheaper and easier to debug.
- Use a runtime LLM only when the task genuinely needs judgement (classification, summarisation, extraction).
- **For real bank data at runtime: it MUST go through Azure OpenAI**, not the public Anthropic API. Data residency is non-negotiable.
