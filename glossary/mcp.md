MCP is the protocol Claude Code uses to plug into the outside world: databases, file systems, APIs, Jira, Gmail, Figma. Each integration ships as an MCP server you register once and then call by name in conversation. The big win is that you don't write glue code every time — the server exposes its capabilities and Claude figures out how to use them.
