An issue is a thread for one piece of pending work — a bug, a feature, an idea, a question. Each issue has a title, a body, labels (`bug`, `enhancement`, `question`), an assignee, and a state (`open` or `closed`).

Why the team uses them:

- The backlog is shared and visible
- Discussion sticks to the issue, not buried in chat
- PRs can reference issues — closing a PR can auto-close its linked issue

Ask Claude in plain English: "list the open issues", "create an issue for this bug", "close issue #42 — I just fixed it". Behind the scenes Claude calls `gh issue list / create / close`.
