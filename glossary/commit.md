A commit is one saved change-set: a few files, a one-line message, and a parent commit it builds on. Together, commits form your project's history.

Key thing newcomers miss: a commit is **local** until you push it. You can commit ten times, change your mind, rewrite history (carefully), and only push the result. Once pushed, others see it — at that point it's effectively immutable.

Claude Code never commits without your explicit "yes, commit". Per the global rules: no version-control operations unless you ask.

Good commit messages explain *why*, not *what* — the diff already shows what changed.
