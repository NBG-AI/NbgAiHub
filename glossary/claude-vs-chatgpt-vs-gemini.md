ai_summary: The big four chatbot brands. All are LLMs you reach through a web/desktop chat. They differ in vendor (Anthropic / OpenAI / Google / xAI), model family, pricing, and tone. Claude.ai is Anthropic's chat product. Claude Code is the *separate* terminal agent — much closer to a developer tool than to any of the chatbots.
tldr: "The big four chatbot brands — Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok. All LLMs in a chat UI; they differ in vendor, model family, pricing, and tone."

The chatbot landscape, condensed:

| Brand | Vendor | What you reach | Best known for |
|-------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Claude** (claude.ai) | Anthropic | Web/desktop/mobile chat | Long context, careful reasoning, thoughtful tone. The model family behind Claude Code. |
| **ChatGPT** | OpenAI | Web/desktop/mobile chat | The original mainstream chatbot. Largest user base. |
| **Gemini** | Google | Web chat + tight Google Workspace integration | Native integration with Gmail / Docs / Drive. |
| **Grok** | xAI | Web chat + X/Twitter integration | Edgier tone, real-time X data. |

**All four are chatbots.** You type, they respond. You can ask them to write, summarise, brainstorm, explain. None of them, by default, can read or edit files on your machine. None of them, by default, can run shell commands. They're brains in jars.

**[Claude Code](/glossary/#claude-code) is a different category.** It uses Claude models under the hood, but it's an [agent](/glossary/#agent) — it runs on your laptop, sees your files, executes commands. Comparing Claude Code to ChatGPT is comparing a coding tool to a chatbot. Comparing Claude Code to *Cursor* or *Cline* or *Aider* is the right level.

**Why we picked Claude (the models) and Claude Code (the tool):**
- Long, reliable context (200K tokens in production).
- Strongest results on hard multi-file refactors.
- Tone that matches how engineering teams want to work — direct, accurate, willing to say "I don't know."
- Terminal-first design that composes with whatever editor you already use.

That doesn't mean the other vendors are bad — pick the right tool for the job. But for the work the hub covers, Claude is the default.
