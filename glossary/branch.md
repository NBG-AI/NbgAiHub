A branch is a parallel line of work in the same repo. The team's default branch is usually `main` (or `master` on older repos). You create a feature branch off `main`, make your changes there, and merge it back through a Pull Request.

Why branches matter: you can experiment, make a mess, change your mind — without touching `main`. The branch is your sandbox.

Day-to-day, you rarely create branches by hand. You ask Claude ("start a branch for this work") or use `/team` / `/gsd-*` skills, which handle branching as part of the workflow.
