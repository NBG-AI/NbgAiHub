GSD is an *optional* community framework for managing Claude Code projects that span weeks or months. The whole idea: persist project state in a `.planning/` folder so Claude (and you) can resume work without re-explaining context.

What lives in `.planning/`:

- `PROJECT.md` and `ROADMAP.md` — the long-horizon plan
- Per-phase folders with discuss / spec / plan / execute / verify / secure steps
- Audit trail for what was decided, why, and when

When GSD pays off:

- Multi-week project, multiple collaborators
- Traceability matters (audit, compliance)
- You need to put the work down and resume next week

When it's overkill:

- One-off scripts, single-sitting prototypes, exploratory hacking

Common commands: `/gsd-new-project`, `/gsd-progress`, `/gsd-do`, `/gsd-next`, `/gsd-help`.
