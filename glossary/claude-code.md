Claude Code is a CLI tool that runs an LLM (Claude) with hands — it can read files, execute shell commands, edit code, and loop on its own work until done. Four things make it different from a chatbot: **hands** (it executes, not just suggests), **context** (it sees the whole project), **loops** (it iterates autonomously), **specialization** (it learns your team's way of working via `CLAUDE.md` and skills).

Mental model: it's a brilliant junior — fast, capable, but you always check what it changed before accepting. Never trust without reviewing the diff.
