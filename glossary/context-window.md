Every Claude session has a finite context window — think of it as Claude's working memory for this conversation. As you keep asking things, the window fills with prompts, code, outputs, and Claude's responses. When it's full, the oldest parts get pushed out and Claude starts forgetting.

Two commands to manage it:

- `/compact` — summarises the conversation so far and continues with the condensed version (good when you're still on the same task)
- `/clear` — wipes everything and starts fresh (good when you're switching to an unrelated task)

The discipline: don't carry irrelevant history. Start fresh for unrelated tasks.
