# NbgAiHub — Scope

**Last updated:** 2026-05-18 (post first successful E2E pipeline run)

## Vision

A curated Claude Code knowledge hub for bank colleagues — a one-stop shop combining skills catalog, tips & tricks, curated news, onboarding journeys, and a shared vocabulary. Tone: *"what I wish I knew a year ago."* The hub compresses newcomers' time-to-confidence, leveraging the ~6 months of head start the AI unit has over the rest of the organization on Claude Code.

## Audience

- **Primary:** Bank colleagues new to Claude Code (joining over the next 6–12 months)
- **Secondary:** Existing intermediate users hunting for tips, news, or new skills

## Repo & hosting

- **Repo:** `github.com/chomovazuzana/NbgAiHub` (personal account, bootstrap mode)
- **Visibility:** **private** (per user override; supersedes prior public decision — see DECISIONS.md)
- **Hosting:** **OPEN QUESTION** — private Pages on personal account requires GitHub Pro ($4/mo). Alternatives: Vercel free, Netlify free, Cloudflare Pages free (all support private GitHub repos as source). Or defer hosting until MVP content exists.
- **Content rule:** since repo is private, team-internal content is permissible — but the repo lives under a *personal* account, not bank-managed infrastructure. Bank-confidential material should still go through compliance review before being stored here.
- **Migration path:** transfer to team org and switch to GitHub Team if the project graduates from personal bootstrap.

## The hub at a glance

**Five user-facing pillars** (each consumed differently; all share one content shape):

| # | Pillar | What it offers | Consumption pattern | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Skills catalog** | Discovery layer over installable plugins (internal + external) | Browse → install via plugin marketplace | not started |
| 2 | **Tips & Tricks** | Patterns, prompts, gotchas, workflow recipes | Read & apply manually | not started |
| 3 | **News** | Curated tech news, AI-triaged from RSS feeds at build-time | Skim weekly | **✅ pipeline operational** |
| 4 | **Curated journeys** | Day 1, Week 1, by-role onboarding paths | Follow step-by-step | Day 1 designed, content TBD |
| 5 | **Glossary + Reference** | Term definitions (hybrid page + anchor links) + cheatsheet | Lookup as needed | not started |

**Cross-cutting substrate** (the same plumbing serves all five pillars):

- **GitHub repo as CMS** — markdown + frontmatter, PR workflow for everything
- **Astro Starlight web UI** — static site, fast, polished, looks like dev docs (not AI slop) *(not yet scaffolded)*
- **Hub-as-skill plugin** — one command installs the hub into Claude Code; exposes `/hub-*` commands *(not yet scaffolded)*
- **Shared content shape** — single frontmatter schema across all pillars (type, audience, topics, internal flag, deeper_link, etc.) *(in use by RSS pipeline)*
- **AI strategy** — build-time RSS triage via Azure OpenAI; runtime AI lives in the user's Claude session via the skill; **no AI on the website**
- **Complementary to the Onboarding guide** at `556lowcodenocode.github.io/Onboarding` — the hub deep-links into it, does not duplicate it

## MVP scope — IN

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| **One curated Day 1 journey** — 6-step path: install → first session → survival keys (incl. `Esc Esc`) → CLAUDE.md (global + project) → skills & team marketplace → where to go next | designed; content TBD |
| **~10 Tips & Tricks entries** | not started |
| **~5 Skills catalog entries** — internal + external, description + install link | not started |
| **~10 Glossary terms** — CLAUDE.md, MCP, skill, plugin, agent, hook, GSD, build-time vs runtime, etc. | not started |
| **RSS curation pipeline** — daily GH Action: fetch feeds → Azure OpenAI triage → `/news/incoming` → PR → editorial review → promote to `/news/published` | **✅ BUILT & OPERATIONAL** — 88/88 tests pass; live E2E run produced PR #1 with 43 items on 2026-05-18. Spec: `docs/refined-requests/rss-pipeline.md`. Verification: `docs/reference/integration-verification-rss-pipeline.md`. |
| **Astro Starlight static site** with beginner/advanced filter | not started |
| **Hub-as-skill plugin** — `/hub`, `/hub-search`, `/hub-news`, `/hub-tips`, `/hub-skills`, `/hub-onboard <journey>` | not started |
| **Hybrid glossary** — canonical `/glossary` page + inline anchor links | not started |
| **Public/private gating** — `internal: true|false` frontmatter | schema defined; in use by pipeline |

## Deferred — LATER

- Week 1 / by-role curated journeys (backend dev, data scientist, ML engineer, etc.)
- Full-text or semantic search across content
- Greek-language content
- Authentication / SSO for gated content
- Community contributions (PRs from outside the team)
- Analytics on what newcomers click
- Expanded news sources beyond the initial five
- Hero image extraction for news items (RSS thumbnail + og:image fallback)
- War stories / post-mortem pillar (6th pillar candidate)
- Migration to team org if/when bank-specific gated content becomes needed

## Out of scope — NO

- Live chat or forum
- Per-user personalization or bookmarking
- Hosting user-generated content
- Marketing-style branding
- Live chatbot widget on the website (the Claude skill IS the chatbot)
- Client-side embeddings or semantic search backend
- Bank-confidential content in this repo (structural constraint of personal account)

## Open questions

For full RSS pipeline context, see refined request: `docs/refined-requests/rss-pipeline.md`.

- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages via Pro, Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare free tier, or defer hosting until MVP content exists?
- **Proof-of-life user:** which specific newcomer joining in the next 4–8 weeks anchors the MVP deadline?
- **Skill distribution:** standalone marketplace at `chomovazuzana/NbgAiHub` or also list in `556LowCodeNoCode/Skills`?
- **RSS source list — currently live in production with 5 seed feeds** (revisable in `config/rss-sources.json` without code change):
  1. Anthropic news — `https://www.anthropic.com/rss.xml`
  2. Claude Code GitHub releases — `https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases.atom`
  3. Simon Willison's blog — `https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything/`
  4. r/ClaudeAI — `https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/.rss` *(may 429-throttle on some runs; per-feed-non-fatal absorbs)*
  5. Hacker News filtered — `https://hnrss.org/frontpage?q=Claude+OR+%22Claude+Code%22+OR+Anthropic`
- **Editorial cadence:** daily Action + ad-hoc PR review (current)? Weekly summary PR? Twice-weekly?
- **News storage model:** per-item permanent (current — files accumulate forever) vs rolling N-day window vs hybrid (storage permanent + UI filters)? Currently per-item permanent; UI is unbuilt.
- **News item hero image:** add `hero_image` frontmatter field, extracted from RSS thumbnail + og:image fallback? Deferred but small to implement.
