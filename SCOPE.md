# NbgAiHub — Scope

**Last updated:** 2026-06-02 (tips 2-column shell with sticky preview pane + topic taxonomy + audience-chip click-target fix + skills featured-panel slimming) — **/tips/ now uses a 2-column shell below the hero+filter: left column carries the existing cluster/orphan listing sections, right column is a sticky `<aside id="tip-preview-pane">` (~420px) that swaps in the hovered tip's title + body via the existing `<script type="text/x-tip-body">` template. At rest the pane shows a quiet placeholder ("Hover a tip on the left to read the full text…"); hover swaps it in, leave restores the placeholder after a 180ms grace. Pane top aligned with the first listing row via `margin-top: 10.75rem` (verified gap=0 via puppeteer across vw 1280–1920). Sticky offset `top: calc(var(--sl-nav-height) + 4rem)` keeps it pinned ~1rem below the filter bar as you scroll. Below 1100px viewport or on coarse-pointer the grid collapses to single column and the pane is hidden — title click-through becomes the sole affordance. The earlier floating-popover (with viewport-edge clamping and scroll-hides) was deleted; `tip-preview.css` keeps the typography rules but the chrome is now `.tip-preview--pane`. Tips topics pinned to a closed five-value Zod enum (`prompting`, `workflow`, `context`, `control`, `safety`) in `site/src/content.config.ts`; the build now fails on any other value. 24 of 27 tips re-tagged: the audience-coded labels (`advanced`, `basics`, `fundamentals`) and singleton labels (`safety`-vs-`compliance` split, `permissions`, `corrections`, `commands`, `integrations`, `examples`, `data-residency`) folded into the canonical five. Topic chip strip shows five clean chips matching the five cluster headings on the page body; the dead `TOPIC_EXCLUDE` set and cluster-match synonyms removed. Authoring rules in `docs/reference/authoring-tips.md` — Topic vocabulary table is the single source of truth for new tips. Sticky filter strip: the `display: contents` flatten previously included `.audience-filter__option` — that removed the option element from the box tree and broke `position: relative` anchoring for the absolute-positioned radio inside, so clicks landed on the wrong audience chip. Excluded → each option keeps its own `inline-flex; position: relative` box; radio hitbox now matches the visible chip exactly (verified via puppeteer `getBoundingClientRect`). Skills featured panel slimmed: one-sentence lede (was a six-item bolded category list), "New to Claude Code?" demoted from a boxed callout to a single quiet line, trailing "Built at NBG cluster below…" paragraph deleted. Skills page rebuilt around the real `NBG-AI/claude-tools` upstream (~37 plugins, developer-focused). Every row now click-throughs to a `/skills/[slug]/` detail page with structured install block (Access → Marketplace → Install → Use). Listing-page filters (skills/tips/use-cases) stick below the Starlight nav as the user scrolls; chips and labels flow as direct flex items of one inline strip — `SHOW [chips] TOPIC [chips]` — via `display: contents` on the inner wrappers so chips wrap freely instead of being trapped behind a per-filter container. Labels shortened to single words (`Beginners` / `Experienced` / `Topic` / `Unit`) and chip vocabulary lifted into shared CSS with `!important` so all three pages render identical chips against Starlight's unlayered button defaults in production. Use-case cards: duration chip restored to the head row with the clock icon (was previously plain text), aligned flush to the card's right edge at rest; on hover/focus/pinned, it smoothly slides left ~2.25rem to clear room for the pin overlay (touch devices reserve the space permanently). Use-cases `UNIT` filter joined the inline strip with the rest (the page-scoped `:global(.hero__filter .topic-filter*) { flex-direction: column !important }` overrides from the pre-sticky layout were removed — they were defeating the shared `display: contents` flow). Unit filter that silently broke when the chip wrapper was moved (`display: block !important` defeated the JS's inline `style.display = 'none'`) is fixed with a `data-filtered-out` attribute + matching `!important` rule.** Featured gold-accented panel at the top of `/skills/` introduces the upstream library honestly — *"the team's developer skill library"* for engineers actively working on NBG software — with a quiet redirect for newcomers to Foundations / Tips / Use cases. Internal-origin rows (`create-sandbox`, `team`, `deploy`, `uat-panel`) carry a gold left border tying them to the panel; community rows (`frontend-design` → repointed to `anthropics/skills`, `gsd` → repointed to `gsd-build/get-shit-done`) sit below. `database-schema-designer` dropped (wasn't real). New `create-sandbox` entry distilled from the actual upstream SKILL.md — an 8-capability lifecycle for building TypeScript API sandboxes from C# source or Postman collections, audience advanced. Schema gained `marketplace_command` + `access_request` (both optional). Skills cluster section dropped the `S1/2` chip — now uses the same serif-title + lede vocabulary as `/tips/`. Row prose spans full card width (meta pills absolute-positioned in top-right). The `claudemd-worked-example` tip was also upgraded — distilled from five sources (Anthropic official best-practices, the viral forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills file, HumanLayer's "under sixty lines" guide, josix/awesome-claude-md, the dev.to maturity-levels piece) with per-section annotation explaining why each block earns its slot. Site live at <https://556lowcodenocode.github.io/NbgAiHub/>. AUTO doc counts (canonical table below): glossary 45, tips 27, skills 6 (database-schema-designer out, create-sandbox in), use cases 12, journeys 2, news 59.

## Vision

A curated Claude Code knowledge hub for bank colleagues — a one-stop shop combining skills catalog, tips & tricks, curated news, onboarding journeys, and a shared vocabulary. Tone: *"what I wish I knew a year ago."* The hub compresses newcomers' time-to-confidence, leveraging the ~6 months of head start the AI unit has over the rest of the organization on Claude Code.

## Audience

- **Primary:** Bank colleagues new to Claude Code (joining over the next 6–12 months)
- **Secondary:** Existing intermediate users hunting for tips, news, or new skills

## Repo & hosting

- **Repo:** `github.com/556LowCodeNoCode/NbgAiHub` (556LowCodeNoCode org)
- **Visibility:** **public** (required for free-tier Pages; was private under personal account, flipped public 2026-05-26, transferred to org 2026-05-29)
- **Hosting:** **LIVE** at <https://556lowcodenocode.github.io/NbgAiHub/> as of 2026-05-26. GitHub Pages under `556LowCodeNoCode` with `build_type: workflow` (Actions deploy). Repo flipped public for free-tier Pages. `base` env-driven via `process.env.PUBLIC_BASE` in `site/astro.config.mjs`; `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` sets `PUBLIC_BASE: /NbgAiHub` at build time; postbuild `site/scripts/rewrite-base-paths.mjs` prefixes known top-level routes that Astro doesn't auto-prefix. `SplashAwareHeader.astro` also uses `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` for the brand `<a href>` and the two NBG wordmark `<img src>` (raw-string attrs aren't covered by Astro's base-aware bundling). See DECISIONS 2026-05-26 (afternoon) entry for the full deploy session, including the Starlight unlayered-cascade learning (now Issue #20) that surfaced as three visual regressions on live and was fixed via `!important` on critical typography + search-trigger properties.
- **Content rule:** since repo is private, team-internal content is permissible — but the repo lives under a *personal* account, not bank-managed infrastructure. Bank-confidential material should still go through compliance review before being stored here.
- **Migration path:** transfer to team org and switch to GitHub Team if the project graduates from personal bootstrap.

## The hub at a glance

**Five user-facing pillars** (each consumed differently; all share one content shape):

| # | Pillar | What it offers | Consumption pattern | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Skills catalog** | Discovery layer over installable plugins (internal + external) | Browse → install via plugin marketplace | **✅ 9 entries cataloguing `556LowCodeNoCode/Skills` marketplace** (team, claudemd, deploy, uat-panel, frontend-design, database-schema-designer, commit-work, jira, gsd) |
| 2 | **Tips & Tricks** | Patterns, prompts, gotchas, workflow recipes | Read & apply manually | **✅ 14 entries** — prompting fundamentals, control keys, context discipline, compliance, permission modes, briefing template |
| 3 | **News** | Curated tech news, AI-triaged from RSS feeds at build-time | Skim weekly | **✅ pipeline operational; site reads `/news/published/` via glob loader** |
| 4 | **Curated journeys** | Day 1, Week 1, by-role onboarding paths | Follow step-by-step | **✅ Day-1 full 6 steps** (install → first session → control keys → CLAUDE.md → skills marketplace → tomorrow); Week-1 + by-role still TBD |
| 5 | **Glossary + Reference** | Term definitions (hybrid page + anchor links) + cheatsheet | Lookup as needed | **✅ 36 glossary terms** (full catalog; canonical count in the auto-synced table above. Project-wide beginner-friendly `tldr` rewrite landed 2026-05-25 evening); reference page deleted in 2026-05-25 nav rework |

**Cross-cutting substrate** (the same plumbing serves all five pillars):

- **GitHub repo as CMS** — markdown + frontmatter, PR workflow for everything ✅
- **Astro Starlight web UI** — **✅ built; Astro 6.3.5 + Starlight 0.39.2; 10 pages render; serving at `localhost:4321`; production hosting deferred**
- **Hub-as-skill plugin** — **✅ shipped 2026-05-19**; one command (`/plugin marketplace add 556LowCodeNoCode/NbgAiHub`) installs the hub into Claude Code; eleven `/hub-*` commands; bundled markdown snapshot; per-user state at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/state.json`
- **Shared content shape** — 13-key frontmatter schema for news (added `editor_confidence`); 10-key base for skills/tips/glossary/journeys ✅
- **AI strategy** — build-time RSS triage via Azure OpenAI; runtime AI lives in the user's Claude session via the skill; **no AI on the website**
- **Complementary to the Onboarding guide** at `556lowcodenocode.github.io/Onboarding` — the hub deep-links into it, does not duplicate it

## MVP scope — IN

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| **One curated Day 1 journey** — 6-step path: install → first session → control keys (incl. `Esc Esc`) → CLAUDE.md (global + project) → skills & team marketplace → where to go next | **✅ SHIPPED 2026-05-19** — `journeys/day-1.md` populated with full 6-step walkthrough; `site/src/pages/start-here/day-1.astro` rewritten to render the journey collection entry via `getEntry('journeys', 'day-1')`; same content also feeds `/hub-onboard day-1` |
| **~10 Tips & Tricks entries** | **✅ 14 SHIPPED** — original 12 on 2026-05-19 (prompting fundamentals (6 rules + bad-vs-good openers), correction phrasing, control keys (Esc), context discipline (`/compact` `/clear`), review-before-accept, Azure-OpenAI compliance); +2 on 2026-05-25 (permission modes / Shift+Tab; the 5-line briefing template) |
| **~5 Skills catalog entries** — internal + external, description + install link | **✅ 9 SHIPPED 2026-05-19** — team, claudemd, deploy, uat-panel, frontend-design, database-schema-designer, commit-work, jira, gsd (all cataloguing `556LowCodeNoCode/Skills` marketplace) |
| **~10 Glossary terms** — CLAUDE.md, MCP, skill, plugin, agent, hook, GSD, build-time vs runtime, etc. | **✅ 36 SHIPPED** — original 5 + ~30 added across 2026-05-19/24/25 (foundations, GitHub vocabulary, AI basics, authoring formats, slash-command, github). Full project-wide beginner-friendly `tldr` rewrite landed 2026-05-25 evening. Canonical count in the auto-synced "Content at a glance" table above. |
| **RSS curation pipeline** — daily GH Action: fetch feeds → Azure OpenAI triage → `/news/incoming` → PR → editorial review → promote to `/news/published` | **✅ BUILT & OPERATIONAL** — 93/93 tests pass (after triage tightening); live runs producing daily PRs. Spec: `docs/refined-requests/rss-pipeline.md`. Verification: `docs/reference/integration-verification-rss-pipeline.md`. **+ unconditional auto-promote (2026-05-19, reverses earlier variant C the same day)** — every relevant triaged item writes directly to `news/published/`; the workflow pushes straight to `main`, no editorial PR. All feeds carry `auto_promote_eligible: true`; the field is retained as a per-feed kill switch but is currently unused. Cross-feed title dedup is now the load-bearing quality control. Workflow still branches on `mode` (`auto_only` / `mixed` / `review_only` / `empty`) so flipping one feed back to `false` is a one-line config change. **+ rolling 7-day retention** — same run prunes any `news/published/<YYYY-MM-DD>-*.md` strictly older than `today - 7d`; deletions land in the same commit as the day's new items. Both DECISIONS 2026-05-19. |
| **Astro Starlight static site** with beginner/advanced filter | **✅ BUILT** — Astro 6.3.5 + Starlight 0.39.2, 10 pages (Home, Start Here→Day 1/Week 1, News, Skills, Tips, Glossary, Reference, Contribute, 404), 7 components (HomeHero, NewsPanel, NewsList, AudienceBadge, SkillCard, AudienceFilter + bonus ConfidenceChip), Pagefind search, dark theme default. Spec: `docs/refined-requests/astro-starlight-site.md`. Verification: `docs/reference/integration-verification-astro-site.md`. Hosting open. |
| **Hub-as-skill plugin** — eleven `/hub-*` commands (`/hub`, `/hub-search`, `/hub-news`, `/hub-tips`, `/hub-skills`, `/hub-glossary`, `/hub-onboard <journey>`, `/hub-install <skill-id>`, `/hub-audience <b|a|both>`, `/hub-refresh`, `/hub-open [section] [subsection]`) | **✅ BUILT & OPERATIONAL (2026-05-19)** — TypeScript workspace at `plugin/` sibling to `pipeline/` and `site/`. **130/130 tests pass** (12 lib test files + manifest + end-to-end entry-script smoke), typecheck + lint clean, esbuild produces 11 ESM entries in `dist/`, bundled snapshot of repo content via `npm run build:snapshot`. Marketplace at repo-root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, plugin manifest at `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Spec: `docs/refined-requests/hub-plugin.md`. Plan: `docs/design/plan-003-hub-plugin.md`. Verification: `docs/reference/integration-verification-hub-plugin.md`. |
| **Hybrid glossary** — canonical `/glossary` page + inline anchor links | **✅ page renders with 5 anchored terms; pattern proven** |
| **Public/private gating** — `internal: true|false` frontmatter | schema defined; in use by pipeline + site |
| **Per-user favourites (PAT-paste + unlisted-gist-backed)** — sign in by pasting a `gist`-scope PAT; pin any content item; favourites stored in the user's own unlisted GitHub gist `nbgaihub-favorites.json`; `/my-pins/` page renders pinned items; same gist consumable by future Claude-side `/hub-*` skill | **✅ BUILT (2026-05-19)** in commits `c1df291`, `5a08260`, `64f83b2`. 127/127 site tests pass. See `docs/refined-requests/personalization-and-contributions.md`, plan `docs/design/plan-003-personalization-and-contributions.md`, gist contract `docs/reference/gist-contract.md`. |
| ~~Skill submission web form~~ | **❌ REMOVED 2026-05-25 (late-night UAT)** — `/submit-skill/` page + `/contribute/` page deleted; PAT-paste form read as a phishing flow to non-devs. Skill submissions now flow through the normal repo PR path. CI validator at `pipeline/src/validators/skill.ts` is retained (still wired to `skills/**/*.md` PR checks). |

## Deferred — LATER

- Week 1 / by-role curated journeys (backend dev, data scientist, ML engineer, etc.)
- Full-text or semantic search across content (currently Pagefind covers full-text; semantic deferred)
- Greek-language content
- Authentication / SSO for gated content
- Analytics on what newcomers click
- Expanded news sources beyond the initial five
- Hero image extraction for news items (RSS thumbnail + og:image fallback) — `hero_image` field reserved in site schema (optional) for forward compat
- War stories / post-mortem pillar (6th pillar candidate)
- Migration to team org if/when bank-specific gated content becomes needed
- Site production hosting (Pro Pages / Vercel / Netlify / Cloudflare)
- Cosmetic refactor of Zod 4 deprecations in `site/src/content.config.ts` (`z.string().url()` → `z.url()`)

## Out of scope — NO

- Live chat or forum
- Hosting user-generated content
- Marketing-style branding
- Live chatbot widget on the website (the Claude skill IS the chatbot)
- Client-side embeddings or semantic search backend
- Bank-confidential content in this repo (structural constraint of personal account)

## Open questions

For full RSS pipeline context, see refined request: `docs/refined-requests/rss-pipeline.md`. For the site, see `docs/refined-requests/astro-starlight-site.md`.

- ~~**Hosting:** GitHub Pages via Pro, Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare free tier, or defer hosting until MVP content exists?~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-05-26.** Live at <https://556lowcodenocode.github.io/NbgAiHub/> on GitHub Pages free tier; repo public.
- **Proof-of-life user:** which specific newcomer joining in the next 4–8 weeks anchors the MVP deadline?
- **Skill distribution:** standalone marketplace at `556LowCodeNoCode/NbgAiHub` or also list in `556LowCodeNoCode/Skills`?
- **RSS source list — live in production with 5 feeds, two source groups** (revisable in `config/rss-sources.json` without code change). Source-group routing in `pipeline/src/triage.ts` SYSTEM_PROMPT:
  - **Reddit group** (`type: "rss"` — reverted from `reddit-json` per DECISIONS 2026-05-21 third entry; engagement filter scaffolding lives in the repo ready to reactivate if OAuth becomes available later):
    1. r/ClaudeAI — `https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/.rss`
    2. r/ClaudeCode — `https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/.rss`
  - **Major tech/AI news group** (`type: "rss"`; professional news + breakthrough AI only; no engagement floor — these are editorial sources):
    3. Hacker News frontpage — `https://hnrss.org/frontpage` *(unfiltered; replaced earlier Claude-keyword variant on 2026-05-18)*
    4. Wired AI — `https://www.wired.com/feed/tag/ai/latest/rss`
    5. The Verge — `https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml` *(full firehose; LLM filters the non-AI noise)*
  - **Dropped feeds** (2026-05-18, by user direction): Anthropic news (RSS feed deleted by Anthropic — returned 404), Claude Code GitHub releases (`releases.atom`), Simon Willison's blog. The latter two are easy to re-add if signal loss is felt.
- **Editorial cadence:** daily Action at **22:00 UTC = 00:00 Europe/Athens (winter) / 01:00 Athens (DST)** + ad-hoc PR review (current). Shifted from 05:00 UTC on 2026-05-21 so the previous day's Reddit posts have time to accumulate `score` / `num_comments` and clear the engagement floor. Weekly summary PR or twice-weekly cron remain open alternatives. Cron lives at `.github/workflows/rss-triage.yml` line 8 — one-line YAML change to flip.
- **News storage model:** per-item permanent (current — files accumulate forever) vs rolling N-day window vs hybrid (storage permanent + UI filters)? Currently per-item permanent; site reads via glob loader and renders chronologically.
- **News item hero image:** add `hero_image` frontmatter field, extracted from RSS thumbnail + og:image fallback? Deferred but small to implement. Site schema already accepts `hero_image` as optional (forward compat).

## Demo-ability checklist (manager review)

- [x] **Site renders locally** — `cd site && npm run dev` → `http://localhost:4321` returns 200; homepage shows hero + tagline; all 9 sidebar entries clickable
- [x] **Day 1 journey page populated with all 6 steps + deep-links into the Onboarding guide** *(2026-05-19 — `journeys/day-1.md` + `site/src/pages/start-here/day-1.astro` renders from the collection)*
- [x] **At least 1 skill entry, 1 tip visible** *(2026-05-19 — 9 skills + 12 tips shipped)*
- [x] **At least 5 glossary terms visible** *(15/10 seeded — 2026-05-19)*
- [x] At least 1 news item visible *(43 items in PR #1 on 2026-05-18; need PR merge to surface in `news/published/`)*
- [x] **Beginner/Advanced/Both filter wired** *(AudienceFilter component built, `localStorage.nbgaihub.audience` persistence; visible no-op until news populated)*
- [x] **`/hub` commands work from a fresh Claude Code install** *(eleven commands ship in `plugin/`; install via `/plugin marketplace add 556LowCodeNoCode/NbgAiHub`; smoke-tested end-to-end on 2026-05-19)*
- [x] **One full end-to-end RSS pipeline run completed** *(run `26047997638`, 2m46s, PR #1, then PR #2/#3 with tightened triage)*
- [x] **Hub installable as a plugin (`/plugin marketplace add 556LowCodeNoCode/NbgAiHub`) in one command** *(marketplace.json points at `./plugin`; plugin.json declares `nbg-ai-hub`)*
- [x] **SCOPE.md + DECISIONS.md tell the story of how we got here** *(this file + 20+ DECISIONS entries through 2026-05-18)*
- [x] **Signed-in user can pin and see pins on `/my-pins/`** *(verified in build — PAT-paste flow validates against `GET /user`; first pin lazily creates unlisted gist `nbgaihub-favorites.json`; `/my-pins/` joins gist `favourites[]` against build-time `<type>-index.json`; stale references render as dimmed "no longer available — unpin" rows)*
- [ ] ~~Anonymous visitor can submit a skill via `/submit-skill/`~~ — *page removed 2026-05-25 (late-night UAT). Contributions flow through the normal repo PR path; CI validator at `pipeline/src/validators/skill.ts` still gates submissions on PR.*
- [x] **UI redesign shipped — Apple-influenced Linear/Vercel/Stripe aesthetic** *(2026-05-19 — see docs/reference/integration-verification-ui-redesign.md for the 39/39 AC verification report; user evaluation at localhost:4321 is the final gate before commit/escalation decision)*
